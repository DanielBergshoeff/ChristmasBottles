    - "IT\u2019S CHRISTMAS! Merry Christmas!!  I love Christmas, it\u2019s the happiest
      day of the year, because dad is always home. Snow is so pretty, and I can throw
      it at Jack. Jack is my brother, he let me write this message. He will put it
      in the bottle. We\u2019re gonna go to grandma now, but she\u2019s a little
      weird. I do like her fries, though. I have to go now. Love, Laila. 25-12-1912. "
