    - 'Dearest recipient,   On the day of writing this message, I received a message
      in a bottle. I have left that message in the bottle, so you may read it as
      well. It is written by a young girl by the name of Laila, whose grandma is
      likely struggling with dementia, who wishes for her to get better. '
    - 'I thought it was such a sweet message, and the craziest thing is that it actually
      ended up right in front of my feet at a beach on Christmas day.  The tone of
      the message really reminded me of my own daughter. She was just as sweet and
      caring at that age, which made me so proud at the time. '
    - "These days, we\u2019re not as close as we used to be, but I know she has been
      having a really rough time, as she has recently lost her husband in the war.
      I know it must be especially hard during this time of year. She and their kids
      are missing him dearly."
    - "I hope she can still find meaning and joy with her children during Christmas,
      and I\u2019ve decided to add that as my wish on Laila\u2019s list. Please continue
      to follow Laila\u2019s instructions if you do find this bottle. "
