    - "Dearest person to get this message,  Exactly five years before writing this
      (it is now christmas day 1917), I wrote a message in a bottle and threw it
      into the water at exactly the place I am now, a beach in California. The same
      day, I met this guy who ended up being the cutest guy I\u2019ve ever seen,
      with the loveliest laugh and a collection of self made playing cards, how cool
      is that!?  "
    - "We\u2019ve been good friends from the moment we met, and I think if I want
      to keep him by my side, I better make him my boyfriend, before he starts liking
      other girls.  Anyway, that\u2019s not what this letter is about. You see, I
      figured if last time I sent a message in a bottle I got lucky like this, perhaps
      I can gather some more luck this way. "
    - "My grandma has been getting more and more forgetful. Mom and dad said it\u2019s
      normal for this to happen when you get older, but I can hear them whispering
      when they think Jack (my brother) and I can\u2019t hear them, and it\u2019s
      more serious than they make it sound. "
    - "My grandma once told me that if enough people really wish for something to
      happen on Christmas, their wish has a chance of being fulfilled. So I\u2019ve
      added a paper with my wish on it to this bottle. If you find this bottle, please
      throw it back into the water, so we can make as many people as possible wish
      for my grandma to get better.  "
    - If the person that finds this has a wish as well, perhaps they can add it to
      mine. Who knows what kind of things can happen.  Love, Laila. 25-12-1917
